# EverydayChallenge_Polymorphism

One of my Everyday Challenge in C++. This time about Polymorphism.

Simple example of using polymorphism. 
Basket object which can store different types of items (inheritance).
In Basket is a function to show all items from basket, showed data are different
for each element in basket, but all of them are using getThirdParam() function (which is virtual in Item).

Nothing special, but works.
